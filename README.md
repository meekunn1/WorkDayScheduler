# WorkDayScheduler

## Description

This project was made to practice using 3rd party APIs such as jQuery and Dayjs. Through this project, I learned to read API documents and learned to use jquery to manipulate the DOM.

## Installation

## Usage

To access, please visit the webpage url:
[Work Day Scheduler](https://meekunn1.github.io/WorkDayScheduler/)

Current Day, Month, Day, Year, and the current time is displated near the top.
To the left shows the scheduler hour , followed by text entry area for the hour in the center, followed by a save button in the right.
Choose the hour of the day for the event, enter the event detail in the text entry area, and left click the save button.
Clicking the save button will save the event information for the corresponding time slot into your local storage, allowing the saved event to reload even if you leave the page.

The text area is color coded based on timing.
Green = Future events
Red = Current event
Grey = Past event

Picture below shows cursor hovering over the save button at 9AM mark.
